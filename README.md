[source: mongo-jira-employee-autologin.user.js](https://github.com/toto-dev/mongodb-jira-custom-scripts/blob/main/mongo-jira-employee-autologin.user.js)

MongoDB jira instance does not log you in automatically. In fact even if you are already login with Okta you will still need to manually click "MongoDB employees" button in order to log in. This script will simply click the button for you.

## Make the "CAR Impact" field visible in jira ticket.
